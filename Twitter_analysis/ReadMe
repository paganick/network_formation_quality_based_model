This folder contains the code used to process the Twitter data-sets, as described in the paper titled "A meritocratic network formation model for the rise of social media influencers".

The folder contains one Jupyter Notebook, which can be run after installing, e.g., the Anaconda package (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).
The notebooks will run Python code. We recommend using Python version 3.7.
Furthermore, the data-set should be first copied in this folder, or the path to them should be specified.
To access the data-set, please follow the instructions reported in the manuscript.
